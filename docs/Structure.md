# 🛠️ Step-by-Step Frontend Development Plan

### **Phase 1 – Project Setup**

* Create React project with Vite
* Install TailwindCSS
* Setup folder structure:
  ```
  src/
   ├── components/
   ├── pages/
   ├── assets/
   ├── layouts/
   ├── hooks/
   ├── utils/
   └── App.jsx
  ```

---

### **Phase 2 – Layout**

* Build `Navbar`, `Sidebar`, `Footer`
* Add `MusicPlayer` fixed at bottom
* Use a grid/flexbox layout with Tailwind:

  * Sidebar (left, hidden on mobile)
  * Main content (center)
  * Player (bottom fixed)

---

### **Phase 3 – Pages**

* Home Page → Featured playlists, trending songs
* Explore Page → Genres, Moods, Charts
* Library Page → User’s playlists, liked songs
* Playlist Page → Track listing
* Search Page → With search bar

---

### **Phase 4 – Auth Flow (Frontend Only)**

* Build `Login`, `Signup` forms with Tailwind
* Fake authentication with local state first (Appwrite integration later)

---

### **Phase 5 – Music Player Functionality (Frontend Mock)**

* Play/Pause button updates state
* Seekbar moves (simulate progress)
* Volume slider works (updates % in state)

---

### **Phase 6 – Polish**

* Dark mode theme (optional)
* Responsive design (mobile → collapsible sidebar, stacked navbar)
* Hover animations, smooth transitions

---

# ✅ Summary (Frontend First)

👉 For **PlayLoud (Frontend)**, you need:

* **Layout**: Navbar, Sidebar, Footer, Music Player
* **Pages**: Home, Explore, Library, Playlist, Search, Login, Signup, Profile
* **Components**: SongCard, PlaylistCard, PlayerControls, SearchBar, ProfileDropdown
* **Flow**: Browse music → Select song → Play in bottom player → Manage playlists

Would you like me to now **draw a wireframe (layout sketch)** of how the **Navbar + Sidebar + Player + Content** should look in React with Tailwind? That way, you’ll have a visual map before coding.
